## Chinese hard-burned subtitles OCR extractor

- Apple Silicon M1/M2 toolchain for extracting .SRT subtitles from Chinese movies with embedded hard-burned subtitles
- the OCR step is using a [modified version of macOCR](https://github.com/glowinthedark/macOCR) (forked from https://github.com/xulihang/macOCR); the macos Apple Silicon ARM64 binary is included in the repo as [OCR](/glowinthedark/subtitles-ocr/blob/master/OCR)

The workflow sequence:

1. Generate cropped video (need to adjust crop area for your video size)
2. Generate PNG snapshots (using `ffmpeg ... fps=1` â€” 1 snapshot per second)
3. Optical Character Recognition using macOCR (Apple Silicon only) outputs JSON file.
4. Convert JSON to SRT + normalize and deduplicate using https://github.com/cdown/srt.
5. Generate Chinese pinyin and traditional/simplified versions.
6. Translate with deepl.
7. Merge translation into the final SRT containing Hanzi Simplified + Hanzi Traditional + Pinyin + English.

# NOTE

- this collection of scripts is work in progress and you'll need to adapt them to your specific scenario (the corresponding places that need editing are marked with TODO comments in the code); use this at your own risk
